  "The CIU catalog in .cljc and in .kotoba, field by field.

  Both are readings of the same `data/datascript-tx.edn`, so this is not two
  implementations of a rule; it is one body of facts written twice, and the
  risk is transcription -- a wrong URL, a dropped field, a topic that lost its
  entry. Every field of every entry is compared, plus the counts and topic
  membership, because a catalog is exactly the shape where checking a sample
  checks the entries someone already looked at.

  `:association-rule/topic` is a SET. A set has no order and `topic` is indexed
  by position, so the port chose the order the data file writes; the assertion
  below compares against that written order rather than against `seq` on a set,
  which is not stable to rely on."
